Hi! I am Lanky and I love to write on stuff. Sometimes , I love to code, explore and interact with people. I I like to see and create new things. I am still learning and it gives me joy to say that, that I am learning, I am failing and I am still in this process. It is graet fun when there is -ing applied. For me, it means it is still happening and I am on the path of doing. I am alive and growing. How beautiful is that?

Sometimes though, I have to curb my lusty nature. Not that lust is wrong but it brings me sorro. It causes envy and jealousy to rise within me and to look in other;s plate instead of mine. I become ungrateful when I am lust-driven, so for that reason I practise gratitude to remember to be grateful of what I have and what I can do with the resources that I have. 

Hope you enjoy my post.
