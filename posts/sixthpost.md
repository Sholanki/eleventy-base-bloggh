Gratitude is a feeling that I used to do out of formality and maybe say "Thank you" to get something in return. My relationship with this feeling of Gratitude has been changing. I used it before to get rid of the feeling of entitlement. Then, I am currently having it for gratitude's sake. I am grateful because
	1. I am alive and I am physically and mentally well.
	2. I have got an amazing gem of a person whom I can respect as a Teacher and who is always enabling me to think for myself
	3. I have got amazing playmates to interact and train with and who are concerned with their self growth and my growth
	4. I have brains to think and make decisions and the ability to ask for help when I am stuck
	5. I have the ability to learn
	6. I have a roof over my head
	7. I have electricity and internet with which I can look up things online and learn and live a comfortable life
	8. I have got money and wealth to celebrate, to spend on myself and others and to celebrate
	9. I have got a good job and great bosses
	10. I have got the literacy and the capability to express myself and communicate my thoughts to others
	11. I am free mentally and physically to choose woth whom I can be interdependent on
	12. I have the capability to create.
	
## Humbling Process

Gratitudeis humbling and it makes me feel abundant with joy and be aware of the things I have which I sometimes take for granted. I have started out listing 10 things to be grateful about in the morning, 10 things that I am grateful about the day that have passed and what I am grateful now for the present. After my 10 minute routine, I start my day with gartitude. It definitely brings a smile to my face and be aware of the things that I have. I have started enjoying the present moment because of this reason: the beautiful sunrise, the amazing 8 hours of peaceful sleep, the 10 minute routine, the playmates that I will be playing with and of course the relationships that I have and I am currently in and the fact that I am never truly alone. I am connected with nature and myself. I am aware and I am grateful.
